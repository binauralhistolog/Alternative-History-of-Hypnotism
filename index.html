class: center, middle

## But First, Some Definitions

---
class: center, middle
## Hypnosis is a mental experience.

## Hypnotism is a ritual between hypnotist and subject.

---
class: center, middle
## Culture Informs Ritual

???
* Rituals are informed by culture.
* To understand the history, we have to understand the culture.

---
# Physician Culture

* Rushed
* Impersonal
* Not comfort based
* Series of instructions that will “fix” things
* Authority based.

## The Usual Story

---
# Discovery of Hypnosis

* Paracelus (1500s)
* Maximillian Hell (1740s)
* Mesmer (1774)
* Marquis de Puységur (1785)
* Abbe Faria (1813)
* Braid (1840s)
* Liebeault (1866) 
* Bernheim (1888)
* Freud (1906)

## More Accurate...

---
# Physicians Invent Hypnotism

* Magnets might heal people. (1500s)
* Magnetized Steel Plates heal people! (1740s)
* I can wave my hands and do it!  I'm magnetic! (1774)
* Magnetism can make you do [really odd things](https://archive.org/details/essayofinstructi00puys/page/n6). (1785)
* Not magnets! Suggestion! (Maybe [lucid sleep](http://www.pnl-nlp.org/download/faria/)?) (1813)
* [I have invented Hypnotism](https://archive.org/details/braidonhypnotism00brai/page/n6). (1840) 
* I'm a doctor, and I'll hypnotize you for free. (1866)
* It looks like people have [subconscious minds](https://archive.org/details/suggestivetherap00bern/page/n6). (1888)
* I'm crap at hypnotism.  I have invented psychotherapy. (1906)

???
- Note that psychotherapy literally came from Freud studying under Bernheim.

# Mesmerism

* Hand Passes!
* Fixed Gazes!
* The Power of the Hypnotist!
* Yelling "Sleep!"

# "Advances" in Hypnotism Pre-Nancy School

* Eye Fixation / Fascination
  * From 1500s by [Agrippa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Cornelius_Agrippa)
  * Popularized by Braid after watching [Lafontaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lafontaine#James_Braid).
* Massive Stimulation (Paris School)
  * Shock the senses with gongs.
  * Tuning forks!
  * Staring into sun from dark room
  * Wake up patients by "applying pressure" to the ovaries.

# Nancy School

* Medical care costs, but hypnosis is free.
* Attempts to make a standardized process out of hypnotism.
* Fascination and repeated suggestions of sleep.
* Lots of people.
* Not cruel but brusk, people kicked out while still fractionated.
* Lots of prepping, no isolation, so social carryover and pressure.
* Worked best with poor, desperate, and highly motivated patients.

???

- Hypnosis: Real or Wack?

---
class: center, middle

Bad Press, confusion with [stage hypnotism](https://www.newtonhypnosis.com/mesmeric-arts/).

Not popular with upper classes.

It failed.  Lots.

Other doctors wouldn't touch it, and didn't understand it.

By 1900, the Nancy school was done.

## Problems with Clinical Hypnotism

---
class: center, middle

Experimental hypnosis has come on strongly, particularly in the last 20 years. 

[Clinical hypnosis has not done so](http://www.mheap.com/nature_of_hypnosis.html).

???
- Erickson stood out for the risks he was willing to take.
- Most therapists will not experiment or try different things with hypnosis.
- There's a stunning amount of ignorance and misinformation out there.
- Lack of accreditation and the stigma attached is a drawback.
- Most hypnotherapists won't touch sexual dysfunction with a barge pole.
- Likewise, therapists won't touch hypnosis, unless you tell them it's CBT.

## The Problem

---
# The Problem

* Look at these dates!
* It's literally 100 years between de Puységur and Bernheim!
* During that time, it was 100 years of direct suggestions!
* The PMR showed up in 1929!
* It took until the 1960s to have decent psychological models!

## What if the Nancy School had a different culture of hypnotism?

---
class: center, middle

## **The Alternative History** 

## (with apologies to Zinn)

---
class: center, middle

## "Hypnotism is a ritual between hypnotist and subject"

## Two roles, playing different parts.

---
class: center, middle

## The Hypnotist engages in an act of **rhetoric**.

## The Subject engages in an act of **meditation**.

---
## So?

* Rhetoric and meditation are not new.
* Rhetoric dates from 5 BC, starting with the Sophists in Ancient Greece.
* Meditation dates from 3000 BC, from India.
* The first "field research" was in the Nancy School and Paris Schools.
* 1866, so Rhetoric and Buddhist meditation would have been available.

---
class: center, middle

## Rhetoric

---
## If Rhetoric had been available

* Rhetoric: literally the art of persuasion.
  * logos: argument from reason
      * (you're sleepy because you're blinking more.)
  * pathos: argument from emotion 
      * (it feels so good to relax)
  * ethos: argument from moral stance 
      * (you can let go and trust your doctor)
* Rhetoric understood elicting emotions first, reasons after.
* Braid recognized that rhetoric was important, but didn't follow up.

---
class: center, middle

Speech is a powerful lord,

which by means of the finest and most invisible body 

effects the divinest works: 

it can stop fear 

and banish grief 

and create joy 

and nurture pity.

## Meditation

---
# More Definitions

* There are several kinds of meditation.
* Generally fall into two broad categories
  * Focused Attention (FA)
  * Open monitoring (OM)
* In Focused Attention, what you focus on is what you get.
* Hypnotic meditation focuses attention on following suggestions.
* Corollary: driving in a car or reading a book does not result in hypnosis.
  * Trance is not the same as hypnosis.
  * Suggestions made to someone reading a book don't work.

## Yoga Sutra

* breath-control (pranayama)
* sense-withdrawal (pratyahara)
* process of calming mind (samatha) 
* concentration (dharana)
* meditation (dhyana)
* result of concentration (samadhi)

---
## Buddhist Thought

* Subjects had no way to describe internal state.
  * No "superego", "ego", "id" before Freud.
  * No way for physicians to understand mental issues.
* Saiva Tantra and Buddhism had models and vocabulary.

---
## Four Levels of Speech
  
* Vaikhari: Ordinary Speech...
* Madhyama: ...is shaped by how you think...
* Pasyanti: ...which is shaped by your unconscious convictions...
* Para: ...which is shaped by your inner awareness.
  
---
## Buddhist Cognitive Model

* Meditation to see how thoughts pass through the mind
* Rumination: thought loops
* Mindfulness to break those loops, break out of patterns.
* Thoughts create reality
  * Yogachara says senses are also consciousness.
  * Literally, what you see is a product of mind. 

---
## Wildass Speculation

* Model says we construct reality from raw input
* Hypnotic Induction involves inserting 'tist into loop.
* Raw Input “eyes tired” → suggestion → “I'm tired because 'tist said so.”
* Through induction, construction becomes a combination of raw input and collaboration from hypnotist.
* In some ways, hypnosis is anti-mindfulness meditation!

---
## Alternative Scenario

* A travelling Yogi/Zen Master shows up at the Nancy School.
* He teaches Bernheim and Freud how the mind works.
* He also establishes meditation as a recurring practice.
* Upper classes prove mental prowess and superiority through hypnosis.
* Mindfulness and Hypnosis Spas become hot 100 years before Esalen.

## The Future

# The Future: Rise of the Amateurs

* Each culture has different conceptions and rituals: 
  * Stage, Physician, Clinical, Research, and now Kink.
* We're not psychologists or physicians: we don't fix people or do therapy.
* We're free to experiment with sex, pain, and conditioning.
* We're able to do long term experiments and studies.
* We don't give a shit about how respectable it looks.
